# Jank
 The Software Behind the Workings of Game Center (IN PROGRESS)
 ## Roadmap
 Currently works through janky image decoding, which is a very stupid thing to do. Instead, it will be running through JSON files as they are quicker to send and can better hold information. Furthermore, all the game history is saved in one JSON file, making it far more easy to understand context.
